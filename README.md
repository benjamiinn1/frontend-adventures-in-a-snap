<h3>Why Adventures in a Snap?</h3>
This project is built in an attempt to increase public intrest in the art of photography.
My goal is to create an environment where people who have any intrest in photography can
get together and learn some new skills all while having fun.

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>

- MERN stack
- passportJS: authenticate with google (will possibly add more login solutions later)
- mongoose: easy interaction with mongoDB (started out with mongodb package instead but made the switch to mongoose)

<h3>Upcoming Updates</h3>

- build an event-lookup component to find upcoming events.
- build an event component to display info about an event.
- build a create event component.
- provide instructor components to allow instructors to use the create/edit event component.
- allow users to sign up for an event.
